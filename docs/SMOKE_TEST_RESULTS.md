### Critical Issues Found and Fixed

#### Issue #7: Participants Table Schema Mismatch (FIXED)
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Feature Blocking
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** Database had `country` column (TEXT, NOT NULL) but code expected `country_code` (CHAR(2)).

**Root Cause:** Mismatch between database schema and feature specification in research.md

**Error Messages:**
```
{"code":"23502","message":"null value in column \"country\" of relation \"participants\" violates not-null constraint"}
```

**Fix Applied:**
```sql
-- Make the existing 'country' column nullable
ALTER TABLE participants ALTER COLUMN country DROP NOT NULL;

-- Add the 'country_code' column as specified in the design
ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS country_code CHAR(2);
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Created 4 participants with different timezones successfully
- ✅ All form validation working correctly
- ✅ Timezone dropdown with 418 IANA timezones functional
- ✅ Country dropdown with proper ISO 3166-1 codes

#### Issue #8: MeetingList Missing fetchMeetings() Call (FIXED)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - UI Not Loading Data
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** Meetings list showed "No meetings found" even after creating meetings.

**Root Cause:** `onMounted()` hook in MeetingList.vue had TODO comment but wasn't actually calling `store.fetchMeetings()`

**Code Location:** src/features/scheduling/views/MeetingList.vue:103

**Fix Applied:**
```diff
File: src/features/scheduling/views/MeetingList.vue (lines 100-109)

  onMounted(async () => {
    loading.value = true
    try {
-     // Fetch meetings would go here
-     // For now, meetings are loaded from store
+     await store.fetchMeetings()
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load meetings:', error)
    } finally {
      loading.value = false
    }
  })
```

- ✅ Pressing Enter skips navigation and jumps to main content
- ✅ Essential for screen reader users and keyboard navigation

#### 2. Keyboard Navigation ✅ PASS
**Test Steps:**
1. Navigated entire application using Tab key only
2. Tested focus order and accessibility

**Results:**
- ✅ **Tab Order:**
  - Logical and predictable
  - Skip link → Navigation → Main content → FAB → Footer
  - No focus traps encountered
- ✅ **All Interactive Elements Accessible:**
  - Buttons, links, form inputs all keyboard-accessible
  - Filter chips, action buttons all reachable
  - Task checkboxes, edit/delete buttons functional

#### 3. Focus Indicators ✅ PASS
**Observations:**
- ✅ Clear visual focus indicators on all focusable elements
- ✅ **Navigation Links:**
  - Focused link shows rounded border
  - Background highlight visible
  - Clear contrast against sidebar
- ✅ **Buttons:**
  - Visible outline or background change on focus
  - Easy to identify current focus position
- ✅ **Form Inputs:**
  - Border color/shadow change on focus
  - Clearly indicates active field
- ✅ No reliance on color alone (uses border/outline)

#### 4. Semantic HTML ✅ PASS
**Observations from Snapshots:**
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- ✅ Semantic landmarks: `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<complementary>`
- ✅ Form elements properly labeled
- ✅ Buttons use `<button>` element (not divs)
- ✅ Links use `<a>` element with proper hrefs
- ✅ Tables use proper table markup with headers

#### 5. Screen Reader Support ⚠️ NOT FULLY TESTED
**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Did not test with actual screen reader (NVDA/JAWS)
- ⚠️ ARIA labels not explicitly verified

## Bugs Found & Fixed

### 🔴 BUG #1: Module Import Error (FIXED)

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Application Broken
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** Application failed to load with Vue Router errors preventing any route from rendering.

**Root Cause:** `src/components/global/CommandPalette.vue` imported `useTasksStore` (plural) but the actual export in `src/features/tasks/store.js` is `useTaskStore` (singular).

**Error Message:**
```
SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/features/tasks/store.js'
does not provide an export named 'useTasksStore'
```

**Impact:** Application completely broken - blank page with console errors, no routes could load.

**Fix Applied:**
```diff
File: src/components/global/CommandPalette.vue (lines 4, 8)

- import { useTasksStore } from '@/features/tasks/store'
- const tasksStore = useTasksStore()
+ import { useTaskStore } from '@/features/tasks/store'
+ const tasksStore = useTaskStore()
```

---

### 🔴 BUG #2: ContinueSection Undefined Error (FIXED)

**Severity:** MEDIUM - Component Error (Non-blocking)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** Dashboard ContinueSection component threw error but didn't block page render.

**Root Cause:** Component tried to access `.value` on a ComputedRef, but Vue automatically unwraps refs in templates.

**Error Message:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
at ContinueSection.vue:71:41
```

**Impact:** Console error on dashboard load, though component didn't prevent page from rendering.

**Fix Applied:**
```diff
File: src/components/dashboard/ContinueSection.vue (lines 71, 75)

- <div v-if="recentActivities.value.length > 0" class="continue-section">
- v-for="activity in recentActivities.value"
+ <div v-if="recentActivities.length > 0" class="continue-section">
+ v-for="activity in recentActivities"
```

**Verification:** Dashboard now loads with NO console errors ✅

---

### 🟢 BUG #3-6: Notes Module Issues (ALL FIXED)

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Feature Non-functional
**Status:** ✅ ALL RESOLVED

**Issue:** Notes module had 4 separate issues preventing functionality:

#### Bug #3: Editor Not Showing (FIXED)
- **Root Cause:** Template condition `v-if="!selectedNote"` didn't check `currentView === 'editor'`
- **Fix Applied:**
```diff
File: src/views/NotesView.vue (lines 495, 111)

- <div v-if="!selectedNote" class="editor-empty-state">
+ <div v-if="currentView !== 'editor' && !selectedNote" class="editor-empty-state">

- const handleCloseEditor = () => {
-   selectedNote.value = null
+ const handleCloseEditor = () => {
+   selectedNote.value = null
+   currentView.value = 'list'
```

#### Bug #4: Autosave Not Creating Notes Without Topic (FIXED)
- **Root Cause:** useNoteAutosave.js only created notes if topicId was provided
- **Fix Applied:**
```diff
File: src/features/notes/composables/useNoteAutosave.js (line 54)

- } else if (topicId) {
-   result = await notesStore.createNote({
+ } else {
+   result = await notesStore.createNote({
     ...noteData,
-    topic_id: topicId
+    topic_id: topicId || null
   })
```

#### Bug #5: Validation Rejecting Notes Without Topic (FIXED)
- **Root Cause:** validateNote() required topic_id
- **Fix Applied:**
```diff
File: src/features/notes/utils.js (lines 237-239)

  if (!noteData.content || stripHTMLTags(noteData.content).trim().length === 0) {
    errors.content = 'Note content is required'
  }

- if (!noteData.topic_id) {
-   errors.topic_id = 'Please select a topic'
- }
+ // topic_id is optional - notes can exist without a topic
```

#### Bug #6: Database Schema Constraint (FIXED - CRITICAL)
- **Root Cause:** Database had NOT NULL constraint on topic_id column
- **Error Message:** `{"code":"23502","message":"null value in column \"topic_id\" of relation \"notes\" violates not-null constraint"}`
- **Fix Applied:**
```sql
Migration: allow_notes_without_topic

ALTER TABLE notes ALTER COLUMN topic_id DROP NOT NULL;
COMMENT ON COLUMN notes.topic_id IS 'Optional topic ID - notes can exist without being assigned to a topic';
```

**Impact Before Fix:** Notes feature completely unusable.
**Impact After Fix:** ✅ Notes fully functional - create, save, persist, view working.
